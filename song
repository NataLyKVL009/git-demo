Hello my friends!
Would you like to celebrate New Year?
Did you make a wish?
Happy new year!
Ho-ho-ho!!!!!
Merry Cristmas!!!!

Let's go to the party!!!!
Would you like to meet with friends?
I guess it is good idea to celebrate New Year eve with friends.
What do you think about it?

I propose the next plan of celebrating.
We can go to the Taksim squere and walk on Istiklal street.
We can taste some turkish sweets, coffee...
But I'm afraid it will be horrable because of big amount of people on touristic place.
